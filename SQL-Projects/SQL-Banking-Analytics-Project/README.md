# SQL Banking Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer, account, and transaction data
for a retail bank using MySQL. The objective is to generate meaningful
business insights related to customer behavior, transaction patterns,
and potential risk indicators that support data-driven decision-making
in a banking environment.

---

## Business Context
Retail banks deal with large volumes of transactional data every day.
However, raw data alone does not provide value unless it is structured,
analyzed, and translated into actionable insights.

In this scenario, the bank wants to:
- Understand how customers interact with their accounts
- Identify high-value customers contributing most to transaction volume
- Detect early warning signals related to low balances and credit risk

---

## Problem Statement
The bank does not have a centralized SQL-based analytical view to monitor
customer performance, transaction trends, and risk indicators.
As a result, decision-making related to customer strategy and risk
management is slow and reactive.

This project addresses that gap by using structured MySQL queries
to analyze banking data and derive practical insights.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics and account behavior
- Evaluate transaction patterns across customers and accounts
- Identify high-value customers based on balances and transactions
- Flag potential high-risk customers using balance and credit indicators
- Demonstrate real-world SQL usage in a banking analytics context

---

## Dataset Description
The analysis is performed on a publicly available banking dataset
that simulates real-world retail bank data.

The dataset includes:
- Customer information (age, location, account type)
- Account-level details (balance, credit score)
- Transaction-level data (date, type, amount)
