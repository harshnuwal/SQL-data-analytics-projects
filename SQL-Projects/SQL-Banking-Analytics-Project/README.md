SQL Banking Analytics Project (MySQL)
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer and loan-related data for a retail bank using MySQL. The objective is to generate meaningful business insights related to customer demographics, income patterns, loan behavior, and digital banking adoption that support data-driven decision-making in a banking environment.

The project is designed as a realistic banking analytics case study, similar to the type of analysis performed by data and business analysts in financial institutions.

Business Context

Retail banks manage large customer bases with diverse income profiles, loan requirements, and levels of digital adoption. Understanding these patterns is essential for identifying high-value customers, improving loan targeting strategies, monitoring potential risk indicators, and promoting digital banking services effectively.

Without structured analysis, valuable insights remain hidden within raw customer data.

Problem Statement

The bank does not have a centralized SQL-based analytical view to understand customer income distribution, loan uptake, and behavioral patterns. As a result, decisions related to loan marketing, customer segmentation, and digital strategy are often reactive rather than data-driven.

This project addresses that gap by using structured MySQL queries to analyze customer data and extract actionable insights.

Objectives

Analyze customer demographics such as age, income, and family size

Identify high-income and high-value customer segments

Evaluate personal loan adoption across income and education levels

Study credit card and online banking usage patterns

Demonstrate practical, real-world SQL usage in a banking analytics context

Dataset Description

The analysis is performed on a realistic banking customer dataset containing 1,000 customer records, designed to closely resemble data used in Indian retail banking scenarios.

The dataset includes customer demographics, financial attributes such as income and mortgage amount, and product usage indicators including personal loans, credit cards, and online banking.

The data was imported into MySQL and validated using SQL queries before analysis.
